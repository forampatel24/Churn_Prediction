# 📡 Customer Churn Prediction System

An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts whether a telecom customer will churn using behavioral, service, and billing data.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn is a major problem in the telecom industry. This project builds a **complete ML pipeline + interactive Streamlit app** to:

* Predict churn probability
* Classify customers into risk levels (Low / Medium / High)
* Provide actionable retention strategies

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Predict whether a customer will:

* `0 → Stay`
* `1 → Churn`

based on usage, billing, and service features.

## 🔍 Data Processing

The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle and cleaned using:

* Removal of duplicates
* Conversion of `TotalCharges` to numeric
* Missing value handling using median
* Encoding using `pd.get_dummies()`

---

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering

Additional features created:

* `AvgMonthlyCharge` → spending behavior
* `TenureBucket` → customer segmentation
* `NumAddons` → number of services used

---

## 🤖 Model Training

Multiple models were trained and compared:

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting
* SVM (RBF Kernel)
* XGBoost (if installed)

### 🔥 Key Techniques Used

* SMOTE (to handle class imbalance)
* StandardScaler (feature scaling)
* Median Imputation
* Stratified Train-Test Split
* Threshold Optimization (instead of fixed 0.5)

---

## 📊 Model Performance

Example output during training:

```
Model                  Acc     AUC     F1    Rec   Thresh
---------------------------------------------------------
SVM (RBF)              ~0.74   ~0.83  ~0.70  ~0.79  ~0.40
```

💡 Focus was on **F1-score and recall** for churn class.

---

## 🔮 Prediction System

Prediction pipeline:

```
Raw Input → Feature Engineering → Imputer → Scaler → Model → Probability → Threshold → Risk Level
```

### Output Example:

```
Prediction      : ⚠️ WILL CHURN
Probability     : 56.19%
Risk Level      : Medium
```

## 📈 Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
* Streamlit
* Plotly
* Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## 🧠 Key Insights (from EDA)

* Customers with **low tenure churn more**
* Customers with **higher monthly charges churn more**
* Customers with **fewer services are more likely to churn**
* Dataset is **imbalanced (~26% churn)**

---

## 🎯 Future Improvements

* Deploy on cloud (Streamlit Cloud / AWS)
* Add FastAPI backend
* Use advanced models (LightGBM, XGBoost tuning)
* Improve UI/UX
